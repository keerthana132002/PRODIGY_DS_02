THIS IS MY PRODIGY TASK 2
Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Internship Task 02
Overview
Welcome to the repository for Task-02 of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. In this project, I conducted thorough data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the "NEW YORK.csv" dataset to uncover insights and patterns.

Dataset
The dataset, "NEW YORK.csv", contains information about [briefly describe the content of the dataset, e.g., properties in New York]. It includes various features such as [list key features/columns].

Tasks Completed
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation, deletion).
Detected and removed duplicate entries.
Standardized data formats and corrected data inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized data distributions using histograms, box plots, and kernel density plots.
Analyzed relationships between variables with scatter plots and correlation matrices.
Identified trends and outliers to gain insights into the dataset.
Tools Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Jupyter Notebook
Key Findings
[Summarize the main insights and discoveries from your EDA, such as significant correlations, interesting patterns, or unexpected trends.]
